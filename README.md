### Hello ðŸ‘‹

Nice to meet you! Thanks for visiting.

After 19 years of experience in marketing & communication positions, I decided in 2018 to make the leap and study web development. My first step was to learn the fundamentals by joining a fulltime curriculum in web development for 7 months. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to code awesome themes for Drupal websites.
