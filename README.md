### Hello ðŸ‘‹

Nice to meet you! Thanks for visiting.

After 19 years of experience as a marketing & communication assistant, I decided in 2018 to take the leap in becoming a professional web developer. My first step was to learn the fundamentals by joining a fulltime curriculum in web development for 7 months. 

Today, I'm looking for my first position as a front-end developer. I have at heart to build interfaces that will make the difference for their users.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the redesign of my personal website (and getting a job!)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the development in Drupal
